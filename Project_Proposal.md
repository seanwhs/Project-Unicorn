# Project Proposal: Spring Boot Application for Managing Cleaners in Shopping Malls

## 1. Introduction

This project proposal outlines the development of a comprehensive Spring Boot application aimed at efficiently managing cleaners in shopping malls across various domains, including employee management, operations, payroll, and learning management. The application aims to streamline processes involved in managing cleaner schedules, payroll processing, staff training, and task assignments.

## 2. Architecture Overview

### 2.1 Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

- **Bounded Contexts:** Identifying distinct bounded contexts for each domain to delineate clear boundaries and responsibilities.
- **Domain Models:** Defining robust domain models, aggregates, and entities representing key business concepts within each domain.
- **Modular Encapsulation:** Ensuring each domain is encapsulated within its respective Spring Boot application for modularity and separation of concerns.

### 2.2 Microservices Architecture

- **Service Decomposition:** Breaking down the application into microservices to independently develop, deploy, and scale each domain.
- **RESTful APIs:** Designing clear and standardized RESTful APIs for communication between microservices.
- **Scalability and Fault Tolerance:** Leveraging microservices to achieve scalability and fault tolerance by isolating failures and scaling components independently.

## 3. Business Justifications and Benefits

**Business Benefits:**

- Increased Productivity: Automation of manual tasks frees up time for employees to focus on core responsibilities, improving overall productivity.
- Faster Decision-Making: Real-time access to data and analytics enables quicker decision-making, enhancing operational agility and responsiveness.
- Improved Task Allocation: Optimized task assignment ensures that resources are allocated efficiently, reducing idle time and improving operational efficiency.

### 3.3 Compliance and Risk Management

**Justification:** The application ensures compliance with regulatory requirements and mitigates risks associated with non-compliance or errors in processes such as payroll processing and employee management.

**Business Benefits:**

- Reduced Compliance Risks: By automating processes and implementing standardized workflows, the application ensures compliance with labor laws, tax regulations, and industry standards, reducing the risk of penalties and legal issues.
- Enhanced Data Security: Robust authentication and authorization mechanisms ensure secure access to sensitive data, mitigating the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.
- Improved Auditability: Comprehensive logging and auditing features enable tracking of changes and actions within the system, facilitating compliance audits and risk management.

### 3.4 Customer Satisfaction and Experience

**Justification:** By optimizing cleaner schedules, ensuring timely task completion, and improving staff training, the application enhances the overall customer experience and satisfaction.

**Business Benefits:**

- Higher Customer Retention: Improved cleanliness and maintenance of shopping malls due to optimized schedules and efficient task completion lead to higher customer satisfaction and loyalty.
- Enhanced Brand Reputation: A positive customer experience resulting from cleaner environments and responsive staff contributes to a favorable brand reputation, attracting more customers and driving business growth.
- Increased Customer Engagement: Integration with learning management systems enables staff training and development, leading to more knowledgeable and engaged employees who can provide better service to customers.
