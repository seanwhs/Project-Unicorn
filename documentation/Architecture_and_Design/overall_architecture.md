# Overall Architecture and Design Document for Spring Boot Backend API Servers

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the architecture and design for four Spring Boot backend API servers: Employee Management, Payroll Management, Operations Management, and Learning Management System (LMS). These servers are designed to provide specific functionalities related to their respective domains while communicating with each other via REST APIs to facilitate seamless integration and data exchange.

## 2. Architecture Overview

### 2.1 Employee Management API Server:

- **Presentation Layer:** Handles HTTP requests and responses. Includes RESTful API controllers.
- **Service Layer:** Contains business logic for employee management operations such as adding, updating, deleting, and retrieving employee records.
- **Data Access Layer:** Interacts with the database using Spring Data JPA repositories.
- **Security Layer:** Implements authentication and authorization using Spring Security and JWT.
- **Exception Handling:** Provides error handling mechanisms to ensure robustness.

### 2.2 Payroll Management API Server:

- **Presentation Layer:** Manages HTTP requests and responses via RESTful API controllers.
- **Service Layer:** Orchestrates payroll processing operations including salary calculation, payment processing, and tax deductions.
- **Data Access Layer:** Utilizes Spring Data JPA repositories for database interaction.
- **Security Layer:** Implements authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure endpoints.
- **Exception Handling:** Handles errors gracefully to maintain system stability.

### 2.3 Operations Management API Server:

- **Presentation Layer:** Processes HTTP requests and responses through RESTful API controllers.
- **Service Layer:** Manages project scheduling, task assignment, staff deployment, and notification handling.
- **Data Access Layer:** Interfaces with the database using Spring Data JPA repositories.
- **Security Layer:** Ensures endpoint security and access control through Spring Security and JWT.
- **Exception Handling:** Implements error handling strategies for robustness and reliability.

### 2.4 Learning Management System (LMS) API Server:

- **Presentation Layer:** Handles HTTP requests and responses via RESTful API controllers.
- **Service Layer:** Implements business logic for course management, user enrollment, progress tracking, and content management.
- **Data Access Layer:** Communicates with the database using Spring Data JPA repositories.
- **Security Layer:** Enforces authentication and authorization using Spring Security and JWT.
- **Exception Handling:** Provides error handling mechanisms for improved system reliability.

## 3. Communication Between Backend API Servers

The communication between these backend API servers is established through RESTful APIs. Each server exposes specific endpoints to allow other servers to access its functionalities and exchange data. For example:

- **Employee Management API Server:** Provides endpoints to retrieve employee information. This data is accessed by the Payroll Management API Server for payroll processing.
- **Payroll Management API Server:** Communicates with the Employee Management API Server to retrieve employee data for salary calculation and payment processing.
- **Operations Management API Server:** Retrieves employee data from the Employee Management API Server to facilitate staff deployment and project scheduling.
- **Learning Management System (LMS) API Server:** Interacts with the Operations Management API Server to retrieve project schedules for course planning and scheduling.

## 4. Dataflow Between Backend API Servers

The dataflow between backend API servers involves specific data items being exchanged based on the functionalities they support. Examples of data items flowing between servers include:

1. **Employee Data:** Employee information such as name, department, position, and contact details flows between the Employee Management and Payroll Management API Servers for payroll processing.
2. **Project Details:** Project schedules, task assignments, and staff deployment information flow between the Operations Management and Learning Management System (LMS) API Servers for course planning and scheduling.
3. **Authentication Tokens:** JWT authentication tokens are exchanged between all servers to ensure secure communication and validate user identity across domains.
4. **Course Enrollment Data:** Information about enrolled users and their course selections flows between the Learning Management System (LMS) API Server and Operations Management API Server to track user progress and manage course schedules.
5. **Payroll Information:** Processed payroll data, including salary details, deductions, and payment records, flows from the Payroll Management API Server to the Operations Management API Server for budget planning and financial reporting.

## 5. System Design Considerations

### 5.1 Database Design:

Utilize a relational database management system (RDBMS) such as MySQL or PostgreSQL for storing data related to employees, payroll, operations, and learning resources. Design database schemas to efficiently represent entities and their relationships.

### 5.2 RESTful API Design:

Design RESTful API endpoints following best practices for resource naming, HTTP methods, and response formats. Ensure consistency and clarity in API design to facilitate easy integration between servers.

### 5.3 Authentication and Authorization:

Implement JWT-based authentication for securing endpoints and validating user identity across servers. Define role-based access control (RBAC) to enforce authorization policies based on user roles and permissions.

### 5.4 Scalability:

Design the system to accommodate future scalability requirements by adopting scalable architectural patterns such as microservices architecture. Implement caching mechanisms and load balancing strategies to improve performance under increased loads.

### 5.5 Security Measures:

Implement HTTPS for encrypting communication between servers to ensure data confidentiality and integrity. Employ secure password hashing algorithms and salting techniques to store user credentials securely.

### 5.6 Error Handling:

Implement robust error
