## 1. Introduction

The Project Initiation Document (PID) serves as a comprehensive guide to outline the scope, objectives, deliverables, timelines, and responsibilities for the development of the Spring Boot application aimed at managing cleaners in shopping malls. This document provides a clear understanding of the project's purpose, key stakeholders, governance structure, and initial planning considerations.

## 2. Project Overview

### 2.1 Project Objectives

The primary objectives of the project are:

- To develop a Spring Boot application for efficiently managing cleaners in shopping malls across various domains, including employee management, operations, payroll, and learning management.
- To streamline processes related to cleaner scheduling, task assignment, payroll processing, staff training, and operational management.
- To enhance operational efficiency, compliance, and customer satisfaction through automation and optimization of key processes.

### 2.2 Project Scope

The project scope includes:

- Development of a comprehensive Spring Boot application comprising multiple microservices for managing different domains such as employee management, operations, payroll, and learning management.
- Implementation of RESTful APIs for seamless communication between microservices and integration with external systems if necessary.
- Integration with databases, authentication mechanisms, security protocols, and deployment platforms to ensure reliability, security, and scalability.
- Development of user interfaces for administrative tasks, reporting, and analytics to facilitate efficient management and decision-making.

### 2.3 Key Deliverables

The key deliverables of the project include:

- Functional prototypes of each domain-specific microservice developed using Spring Boot.
- RESTful APIs for communication between microservices and external systems.
- Database schemas and data access layers for storing and retrieving relevant information.
- User interfaces for administrative tasks, reporting, and analytics.
- Documentation including API specifications, technical design documents, and user manuals.
