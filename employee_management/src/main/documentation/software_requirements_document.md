# Software Requirement Document for Spring Boot Employee Management API Server

## 1. Introduction

The Spring Boot Employee Management API Server provides a centralized system for managing employee data and operations through RESTful API endpoints. This document outlines the requirements for the development of this backend server, which is intended to function as a monolithic application and communicate with other domain servers via REST APIs.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 User Management

- The system supports CRUD operations for managing user data via RESTful API endpoints.
- Users can register with the system, providing necessary information such as username, email, and password via RESTful API endpoints.
- Registered users can securely log in to the system via RESTful API endpoints.
- The system differentiates between admin and regular users through role-based access control.

### 2.2 Employee Management

- Admin users can perform CRUD operations on employee records via RESTful API endpoints.
- Employee records contain information such as name, email, phone number, department, and position, accessible through RESTful API endpoints.
- Regular users have read-only access to employee records via RESTful API endpoints.
- Employees are searchable by name, department, or position via RESTful API endpoints.

### 2.3 Department Management

- Admin users can manage departments, including creating, updating, and deleting departments via RESTful API endpoints.
- Each department has a unique name and a description, accessible through RESTful API endpoints.

### 2.4 Position Management

- Admin users can manage positions within the organization via RESTful API endpoints.
- Positions have a name and a description, accessible through RESTful API endpoints.

### 2.5 Reporting Structure

- The system supports defining reporting structures for employees via RESTful API endpoints.
- Admin users can assign supervisors to employees via RESTful API endpoints.

### 2.6 Authentication and Authorization

- Authentication is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) via RESTful API endpoints.
- Authorization is role-based, with different levels of access for admin and regular users via RESTful API endpoints.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Performance

- The system handles concurrent requests efficiently via RESTful API endpoints.
- Response times for API calls are optimized to ensure a responsive user experience.

### 3.2 Security

- All communication with the server is encrypted using HTTPS via RESTful API endpoints.
- User passwords are stored securely using encryption techniques.
- Access to sensitive data and operations is restricted based on user roles via RESTful API endpoints.

### 3.3 Reliability

- The system is highly available, with minimal downtime.
- Backup and recovery mechanisms are implemented to ensure data integrity.

### 3.4 Scalability

- The system is designed to accommodate future scalability requirements.
- Horizontal scaling is supported to handle increased loads.

### 3.5 Maintainability

- Code is well-structured and documented to facilitate ease of maintenance.
- Regular code reviews are conducted to ensure code quality and adherence to best practices.

## 4. Constraints

- The backend server is developed using the Spring Boot framework.
- The system is implemented as a monolithic application for the purpose of this project.

## 5. Glossary

- Admin User: A user with elevated privileges, capable of performing administrative tasks.
- Regular User: A standard user with limited privileges, primarily for accessing and viewing data.

## 6. Appendices

- Appendix A: API Documentation
- Appendix B: Database Schema
